                <h1>Summer Research Project - CircuitCraft</h1>
                <p>Over Summer 2024, I worked on a Summer Research Project with my faculty Kathryn Lenth and classmate Makenna Worley to create CircuitCraft. 
                    CircuitCraft is a user-friendly web application that simplifies the creation and supports students’ understanding of circuit diagrams.
                    By making this process more accessible and educational, this project will help future CMPT 328: Computer Architecture students improve their circuit diagram comprehension.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p><strong>For this project, I expanded upon my knowledge in React, and learned about and implemented the React Flow library.
                    I was the designated git person for merging and I realized I love merge conflicts because it provides a good challenge!
                </strong> <br />I am excited for this application to be used as an educational tool by future Westminster Computer Science students.

                <h1>Software Engineering - Project</h1>
                <p>For my Software Engineering class, I was on a team of four people and we worked on a game designed to help students practice the basic mathematical concepts of one and two digit addition and subtraction that they have been learning in their classes.
                    Our main/primary users for this game are the 1st and 2nd grade (6 and 7-year olds) students.
                </p>
                <p>I learnt more about version control through git as well as Agile methodologies. We went through three iterations and stimulated a professional work environment in the classroom.
                    We formatted our game as a web application by using <strong>fresh as our full stack web framework that interacts with Deno Deploy as the distributed platform for our serverless JavaScript application, so I am learned REACT, typescript and JavaScript for this project</strong>.

                <h1>Web Applications - Project</h1>
                <p>For my Web Applications class, I was in a team of developers collaborating with Communications major students as the designers.
                    We created a web application for our client, Jenna White, the owner of Empire Body Waxing. Empire Body Waxing is a local (to Salt Lake City, UT), membership-based waxing salon committed to encouraging body inclusivity and connecting communities. Our application will be helping our client with promoting and showcasing her business, improving accessibility for her customers, and creating a more intuitive flow to the website.</p>
                <p><strong>I got the opportunity to learn the Django framework working on this real world application. We utilized the git version control for this project as well</strong>.</p>

                <h1>Databases - Final Project</h1>
                <p>For my final project for Databases class, I made a web-based database application using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Jinja, JavaScript and SQL. 
                    This application serves the purpose of being a rent management system for a library, where a small library can check customers out for a book they want to rent. The user (a hypothetical library employee) can also run reports on the books, rentals, and the genres and view them.
                </p>
                <p><strong>My learning objective with this full-stack development experience was to gain proficiency in Flask, understand API end points and learn about and implement some REST API principles</strong>.</p>

                <h1>Dear Asian Youth Kathmandu</h1>
                <p>I had the pleasant opportunity to make a website for the organization "Dear Asian Youth Kathmandu". 
                    I got to know more about the wordpress codes while turning the static HTML files into a custom wordpress theme.
                    The custom wordpress theme was made to suit the needs of my client as they would have to frequently upload articles and posts on the website without any knowledge in HTML.
                </p>
                <p>It is great being able to get feedbacks in real time and getting to implement that.</p>
