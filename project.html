                <h1>TasteBook—Recipe Sharing App: Senior Capstone Project</h1>
                <p>
                    I built TasteBook, a cross-platform mobile application in Kotlin that lets users save, organize, 
                    and share family recipes across iOS and Android. The front end is written in Kotlin using Compose Multiplatform 
                    and Jetpack Compose UI; the back end is powered by a Ktor-based RESTful API that handles CRUD operations on 
                    recipes, user authentication, photo uploads, inventory management, and automated grocery-list generation. 
                    As an international student, I designed TasteBook to go beyond borders of time and place, 
                    enabling students like me to preserve their family's cooking traditions. From defining data 
                    models and writing JSON serializers to implementing coroutines for asynchronous network calls, 
                    this project encompassed end-to-end mobile and server development, version control, and iterative 
                    user-centered design.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through TasteBook, I tackled every phase of a solo software project—requirements gathering, 
                    architecture design, implementation, testing, and deployment—gaining deep problem-solving experience in 
                    Kotlin mobile development. Learning mobile application dev and Kotlin was a huge learning curve for me. 
                    Designing the app’s layered architecture and data flows reinforced my object-oriented software design 
                    skills and my ability to work across multiple paradigms and languages (Compose UI, Ktor server, JSON). 
                    Integrating the mobile client with the operating system, network, and persistent storage sharpened my 
                    system-level understanding of how programs interface with OS and network layers. University-wide, 
                    crafting custom UI layouts and user flows honed my creativity; planning feature interactions and handling 
                    edge-case errors honed my critical thinking; building intuitive screens strengthened my communication 
                    through visual design; and the app’s mission of preserving cultural food practices embodied 
                    global responsibility. This capstone reflects both my robust technical competencies and a commitment to the 
                    broader learning goals of Westminster’s school-wide and CS program.

                <h1>Computer Networks - Chatroom Protocol</h1>
                <p>
                    For my Computer Networks course, I collaborated with Makenna Worley 
                    and two other classmates to design our own custom chatroom protocol from 
                    the ground up, drawing inspiration from HTTP/HTTPS but defining every header 
                    field, length indicator, and checksum ourselves. I built the Java Swing client—
                    using Maven to manage builds and dependencies—and implemented the socket-level 
                    logic to format and send messages according to our specification. On the server side, 
                    Makenna wrote a Rust server application that spawns a thread pool to handle concurrent 
                    connections, parse incoming packets, and broadcast chat messages. Through iterative 
                    integration testing and careful error handling, we ensured that our end-to-end system 
                    reliably supported real-time, full-duplex messaging.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working side-by-side on this protocol sharpened several of my Westminster learning goals. 
                    Collaborating with Makenna reinforced my clear technical communication skills 
                    Crafting a layered protocol design and a user-friendly Swing interface tapped into my creativity, 
                    as I translated abstract requirements into concrete packet structures and intuitive screens. 
                    This project not only strengthened my collaborative development skills but also gave me real-world, 
                    system-level networking and concurrent-programming experience.

                <h1>Summer Research Project - CircuitCraft</h1>
                <p>
                    Over Summer 2024, I worked on a Summer Research Project with my faculty 
                    Kathryn Lenth and classmate Makenna Worley to create CircuitCraft. CircuitCraft 
                    is a user-friendly web application that simplifies the creation and supports students’ 
                    understanding of circuit diagrams. By making this process more accessible and educational, 
                    this project will help future CMPT 328: Computer Architecture students improve their 
                    circuit diagram comprehension. For this project, I expanded upon my knowledge in React, and 
                    learned about and implemented the React Flow library. I was the designated git person for 
                    merging and I realized I love merge conflicts because it provides a good challenge! 
                    I am excited for this application to be used as an educational tool by future Westminster 
                    Computer Science students.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This research experience addressed several key learning goals. On the Computer Science side, 
                    collaborating with Kathy and Makenna gave me significant project experience in both individual 
                    contributions (designing core React components and flow logic) and group settings (coordinating 
                    merges, resolving conflicts, and defining feature requirements). It also deepened my proficiency 
                    in object-oriented and event-driven programming through hands-on use of modern web technologies. 
                    University-wide, designing intuitive UI flows and integrating complex libraries tapped into my 
                    creativity, resolving merge conflicts and maintaining a shared codebase strengthened my collaboration, 
                    crafting component documentation and demos improved my communication, and troubleshooting intricate 
                    React Flow behaviors honed my critical thinking. This summer research was an amazing experience and taught 
                    me to apply theoretical concepts in a practical, educational context.

                <h1>Web Development and Publications Intern - Summer 2024</h1>
                <p>Over Summer 2024, I worked with the Registrar’s Office and Office of Marketing and Communication on a custom internship; 
                    I noticed issues within the coding of Academic Catalog, and proposed an internship opportunity to fix the accessibility issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>For this internship, I worked on resolving bugs related to website responsiveness, functionality, and user experience. 
                    As I was given the freedom to self-direct, I got to experiment with different optimization strategies. I then utilized regular expressions to clean up the code. 
                    By working on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) through page titles, I contributed to the challenge of improving the site score; 
                    <strong>the overall site score for the Academic Catalog went from an 85 to a high of 92! (see images)</strong>

                <h1>Software Engineering - Project</h1>
                <p>
                    For my Software Engineering class, I was on a team of four people 
                    and we worked on a game designed to help students practice the basic mathematical 
                    concepts of one and two digit addition and subtraction that they have been learning 
                    in their classes. Our main/primary users for this game are the 1st and 2nd grade (6 and 
                    7-year-olds) students. We formatted our game as a web application by using Fresh as our 
                    full-stack web framework that interacts with Deno Deploy as the distributed platform 
                    for our serverless JavaScript application, so I learned React, TypeScript, and JavaScript 
                    for this project. Through this assignment, I demonstrated the CS learning goal of acquiring 
                    significant project experience in both individual and group settings and sharpened my proficiency 
                    in multiple programming paradigms—crafting client-side React components and configuring a 
                    serverless back end on Deno Deploy.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learnt more about version control through git as well as Agile methodologies. We went through 
                    three iterations and simulated a professional work environment in the classroom. Facilitating 
                    stand-up meetings every class and stepping in to resolve team miscommunications strengthened my 
                    communication skills and reinforced my adaptability—key aspects of Westminster’s Collaboration goal. 
                    Iterating on our game’s features and resolving merge conflicts demanded critical thinking as I 
                    analyzed user feedback and technical constraints, and tapping into fresh UI ideas engaged my creativity 
                    to make the math practice both fun and educational for young learners.

                <h1>Web Applications - Project</h1>
                <p>
                    For my Web Applications class, I was part of a development team collaborating with 
                    Communications majors who led the design effort to build a website for Jenna White, owner 
                    of Empire Body Waxing in Salt Lake City, UT. Empire Body Waxing is a membership-based waxing 
                    salon committed to encouraging body inclusivity and connecting communities. Our application showcases her 
                    services, streamlines the membership process, and improves accessibility with clear navigation and responsive 
                    layouts. I got the opportunity to learn the Django framework by building models, views, and templates tied to a 
                    PostgreSQL database, and we relied on Git for version control to coordinate feature branches and pull requests.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working side by side with Communications majors and a real‐world client strengthened both my 
                    technical and interpersonal skills. Translating Jenna’s business goals into technical requirements 
                    sharpened my communication as I learned to ask the right questions and write clear user stories. 
                    Coordinating code merges and etiquette around Git branches reinforced collaboration and exposed me to professional 
                    team workflows. Prototyping intuitive page flows demanded creativity, while adapting Django’s ORM and template 
                    language to meet accessibility standards involved critical thinking. This project not only broadened my web 
                    development toolkit but also embodied Westminster’s emphasis on teamwork and effective communication.

                <h1>Databases - Final Project</h1>
                <p>
                    For my Databases final project, I developed a web-based application using Python, Flask, HTML, 
                    CSS, Jinja templates, JavaScript, and SQL to serve as a rent-management system for a small library. Library staff can 
                    log in to check customers out for books they wish to rent, track due dates, and generate reports on book rentals, customer 
                    activity, and genre statistics. I designed the database schema to be fully normalized, implemented RESTful API endpoints 
                    for CRUD operations on books and rentals, and used Flask’s routing and template engine to render dynamic pages. Building 
                    this from the ground up gave me hands-on experience translating class lectures on relational design and SQL querying into a 
                    working full-stack application.    
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project demanded both critical thinking and creativity. Crafting an efficient, normalized schema required careful analysis 
                    of entity relationships and edge cases—such as handling multi-genre titles—while designing intuitive Jinja-based interfaces and 
                    report pages let me flex my creative skills in presenting complex data clearly. Overall, applying theoretical database concepts 
                    to this real-world scenario solidified my understanding of backend development and REST principles while demonstrating the core 
                    learning goals of problem solving and effective software design.

                <p>I had the pleasant opportunity to make a website for the organization "Dear Asian Youth Kathmandu". 
                    I got to know more about the wordpress codes while turning the static HTML files into a custom wordpress theme.
                    The custom wordpress theme was made to suit the needs of my client as they would have to frequently upload articles and posts on the website without any knowledge in HTML.
