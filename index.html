            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m a recent graduate at Westminster University, majoring in Computer Science with 
                a minor in Applied Mathematics. Originally from Kathmandu, Nepal, I bring a diverse 
                perspective to everything I do and love collaborating with people across cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m honored to be Westminster’s Outstanding Computer Science Student of the Year 2025 
                and the recipient of the Neisen R. Bank Memorial Award. Established in 1953, the 
                Neisen R. Bank Award recognizes a first-generation graduating senior who has 
                shown exceptional tenacity and academic excellence, and who embodies Westminster’s 
                core values—respect for diverse perspectives, collaboration, and personal and social responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through my coursework—Software Engineering, Web Applications, Computer Architecture, 
                Operating Systems, and Artificial Intelligence—I’ve learned agile methodologies, the software 
                development cycle, client interaction, and core architecture concepts. As a Website Developer 
                for an organization in Nepal, I honed my ability to communicate ideas and turn them 
                into concrete solutions; you can explore my code and documentation on GitHub. During my 
                internship at Aawaaj News in 2021-22, I wrote articles to help destigmatize mental health 
                and taboos back home, an experience that strengthened my written communication and global responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m passionate about creating user-friendly, responsive websites and thrive in collaborative, 
                team-based environments. Whether facilitating stand-ups in an Agile workflow or resolving 
                merge conflicts as the designated Git lead, I embrace new challenges as opportunities for growth. 
                I’m a curious learner dedicated to continuous improvement—feel free to browse my projects below to 
                see how I’ve put these skills into practice.
            </p>

            <p class="bigger-font"><strong>Description about my current and past projects can be found here.</strong></p>
            <button><a href="project.html">Project</a></button>
            <p>
                My ‘Articles’ tab contains most of the articles I have written for Aawaaj News during my internship with them. Through this experience, I got to speak up and be a part of destigmatizing mental health and taboos back home in Nepal. It was very nice to be socially active and I hope to continue being able to gain new experiences and tackle challenges that will expand my skillset.
            </p>
